Datatype :- datatype defines which type of data we are storing 

let a = 10;// datatype ->NUMBER
let a = "sarthak" -> String 

there are 2 types of datatype 
1. primitive DT  => NUMBER , String , boolean [true , false] , undefined , null, NAN
   predefined datatype -> already defined 
   
2. Non primitive DT => Array , Object , function
    user defined datatype 

// we can write the string in 3 ways
1. 'sarthak' -> single quote
2. "sarthak" -> double quote
3. `sarthak`  -> backtick -> JS ES6




Task :- based on the datatype and variable 

1. Change the value of a variable declared with let:
. Declare a variable score and set it to 10.
. Later, update it to 25 and print the result.

1. Declare three variables:
A string called userName
A number called userAge
A boolean called isStudent
Print all three to the console.

1. Write a program that takes 2 variables, a = "5" and b = 3.
 print the sum of a + b.

1. Declare a constant variable PI with value 3.14.
Try to change its value and observe the error.


5. Declare Using let Multiply 7 by 8 and display the result using document.write.
